NoteVoice
===
NoteVoice is meant to be a straightforward, flexible note reader which can play the selected tone from the standard treble or bass clef.  The frontend is an HTML file which uses a percentage-based layout to scale to any size on any device.  The SoundManager2 library is used to play the audio files in iOS devices.  Additionally, a couple of octave/matlab scripts are included that can generate all of the necessary tones.  The scripts can be altered to generate any tone for any playlength at varying sample rates and fade lengths.  The /site/ directory contains the HTML frontend.
